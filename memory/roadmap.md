# Prometheus — Roadmap / Backlog

Living backlog of improvements and new features. Unlike `memory/specs/`, items here are
**not** run through the full SDD pipeline (spec-writer → developer → test →
security-reviewer → human-approved → docs → release) — that process is kept for
already-shipped, security-critical work. Backlog items below are implemented directly,
**one branch per item**, to move faster and spend fewer tokens per change.

**The only non-negotiable rule carried over from SDD**: every branch that closes an item
must update `README.md` and the relevant page(s) under `memory/wiki/` in the same PR/commit
set — this file is not a substitute for real docs, it's a queue.

Branch naming: `feat/RM-<id>-<slug>` (e.g. `feat/RM-05-manager-tui-api-split`).

## Priority order and rationale

Ordered so that foundational/refactor work and cheap risk-reducing research come first,
features that depend on them come after, and pure-polish items come last. Items marked
**(added)** were not in the original request — they came out of the repo audit and are
folded in here per your "muchos más que vayas encontrando."

| # | Item | Status | Depends on |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| [RM-01](#rm-01-restore-ci-now-that-the-repo-is-public-added) | Restore CI on GitHub Actions (added) | done | — |
| [RM-02](#rm-02-extend-pre-push-hook-to-managertelemetry-added) | Extend pre-push hook to `manager`/`telemetry` (added) | done | RM-01 |
| [RM-03](#rm-03-pick-a-real-license-added) | Pick a real LICENSE (added) | done | — |
| [RM-04](#rm-04-dependency-vulnerability-scanning-added) | Dependency vulnerability scanning (added) | done | RM-01 |
| [RM-05](#rm-05-split-manager-tui-from-its-rest-api-item-4) | Split manager's TUI from its REST API (item 4) | done | — |
| [RM-06](#rm-06-research-the-best-inference-serving-stack-item-7) | Research best inference-serving stack per hardware (item 7) | done | — |
| [RM-07](#rm-07-fine-grained-per-model-authorization-scopes-item-2) | Fine-grained per-model authorization scopes (item 2) | done | — |
| [RM-08](#rm-08-distributed-inference-across-multiple-hosts-item-5) | Distributed inference across multiple hosts (item 5) | done | RM-05, RM-06 |
| [RM-09](#rm-09-multi-modal-model-support-item-6-done-vlm--embeddings) | Multi-modal model support: VLM + embeddings (item 6, scoped) | done | RM-05, RM-06 |
| [RM-10](#rm-10-gateway-admin-dashboard-item-3) | Gateway admin dashboard (item 3) | todo | RM-05 |
| [RM-11](#rm-11-auth-module-dashboard-redesign-item-1) | Auth module dashboard redesign (item 1) | todo | RM-07 (do together) |
| [RM-12](#rm-12-e2e-llm-tracing-with-langfuse-item-8) | E2E LLM tracing with Langfuse (item 8) | todo | — |

Why this order, briefly:
- **RM-01 to RM-04** are cheap, low-risk, and matter more now that this moved from an
  internal GHE repo to a public one (no CI was running at all; no license; no dependency
  scanning on security-sensitive code like the gateway/auth-service).
- **RM-05** (manager TUI/API split) blocks RM-08, RM-09, and RM-10 — building distributed
  support, new modalities, or a gateway dashboard on top of the current mixed
  TUI+API module means redoing that work later.
- **RM-06** (engine research) is cheap (mostly investigation) and should inform how RM-08
  and RM-09 are designed, so it goes before them even though it was item 7 in your list.
- **RM-07** (fine-grained scopes) is independent but should land before RM-11 (auth
  dashboard redesign) so the new UI is built once against the final permission model
  instead of twice.
- **RM-11** (auth UI) and **RM-10** (gateway dashboard) are placed after their backend
  dependencies so they're not rebuilt.
- **RM-12** (Langfuse) is purely additive on top of the existing OTel/Tempo pipeline —
  lowest urgency, do whenever.

## RM-01 — Restore CI on GitHub Actions (added) — `done`

**Why**: GitHub Actions workflows existed (`ci-pr.yml`, `cd-develop.yml`, `cd-main.yml`)
but were deleted because Actions was disabled on the old internal GHE instance this project
originated on. That
constraint no longer applies on the new public GitHub repo. Right now nothing runs
server-side on a PR — only the local `.githooks/pre-push`, which is opt-in and skippable.

**Done**: added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — it runs `bash .githooks/pre-push` on every
PR and on push to `main`, so local and CI checks can't drift apart (single source of
truth, no duplicated step list). Scope intentionally kept to exactly what the hook
already does — gateway + auth-service (lint/format/mypy/pytest) + the two bash test
suites. Extending it to `runtime/manager`/`telemetry` is RM-02, on purpose, so that
change and the formatting fixes it needs land together.

Running the hook end-to-end to validate this surfaced two pre-existing, unrelated bugs,
fixed in the same branch since they blocked CI going green:
- `runtime/tests/test_runtime_scripts.sh` AC-11 called bare `python3 -c "import yaml..."`
  — fails on any machine/runner without a global `pyyaml` (this repo has no top-level
  Python env, only per-package `uv` venvs). Fixed to `uv run --with pyyaml python3 ...`.
- `scripts/tests/test_scripts_023.sh` AC-1 asserted `gateway/.env.podman.example` must
  have an active (uncommented) RHEL-path `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` — stale since the earlier
  Ubuntu/DGX work correctly commented it out there (RHEL and Debian/Ubuntu CA bundle
  paths differ, and `gateway/.env.podman.example` is now a shared, not RHEL-only,
  template). Narrowed the check to `.env.redhat.example` and `auth-service/.env.example`.

## RM-02 — Extend pre-push hook to `manager`/`telemetry` (added) — `done`

**Why**: `.githooks/pre-push` only lints/type-checks/tests `gateway/` and
`auth-service/`. `runtime/manager` has its own `pyproject.toml` and a 9-file test suite
that nothing currently enforces — confirmed drift already exists (`ruff format --check
runtime/manager/` currently fails on 12 test files). `telemetry/` isn't covered either.

**Done**: added lint + format + pytest for `runtime/manager`, and lint + format + mypy +
pytest for `telemetry` (both to `.githooks/pre-push`; `ci.yml` inherits them for free
since it just runs the hook). Fixed the pre-existing drift to get there: 78 ruff findings
and 12 unformatted files in `manager` (all mechanical — unused imports, line length,
`contextlib.suppress`, combined `with` statements, one `noqa: E402` for two imports that
must stay after an intentional early `configure_logging()`/`truststore` setup), plus 6
ruff findings and 1 stale `type: ignore` in `telemetry`. All 142 manager tests and 30
telemetry tests still pass after the fixes.

**Deliberately not done**: `mypy` for `runtime/manager`. Its `pyproject.toml` already
declares `strict = true` but it was never actually enforced — running it surfaced ~86
pre-existing errors, mostly missing type annotations on the `pmgr` CLI's click commands
in `cli/main.py`. Fixing that now would mean deep-editing a process-lifecycle-controlling
module outside this change's scope, so it's carried forward as required scope for
**RM-05** (which restructures these exact files) instead of being fixed twice.

## RM-03 — Pick a real LICENSE (added) — `done`

**Why**: README currently says `TBD` after the original internal-use notice was removed. A
repo without a license is "all rights reserved" by default, which may not be what you want.

**Done**: Apache-2.0 (user's choice — explicit patent grant vs MIT). Added `LICENSE` at
the repo root, updated the README section to link it. Per-package `pyproject.toml` files
(`gateway`, `auth-service`, `telemetry`, `runtime/manager`) don't declare a `license`
field — left alone, out of scope here; add if any of them ever get published to PyPI.

## RM-04 — Dependency vulnerability scanning (added) — `done`

**Why**: no SCA tool runs today. `gateway`/`auth-service` sit directly in the security
path (JWT, crypto, bcrypt) and are now publicly visible.

**Done**: both. `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly `uv` ecosystem updates against the
single workspace `uv.lock` (root, covers all four packages), plus weekly
`github-actions` updates. And a `pip-audit` step in `ci.yml`, run as
`uv run --with pip-audit pip-audit -l` (audits the already-synced workspace venv
in place — no separate `uv export`/ephemeral-venv dance needed). Currently reports
no known vulnerabilities. Kept out of `.githooks/pre-push` deliberately: it calls
PyPI/OSV over the network, which shouldn't be able to block a local `git push`.

## RM-05 — Split manager's TUI from its REST API (item 4) — `done`

**Why (revised from the original write-up)**: initial code review found that module-level
separation (`api/`, `tui/`, `cli/`) already existed and imports were already clean — the
real problem the user meant was **packaging**: one `uv` package/`pyproject.toml` for
everything meant the API's container image installed Textual/Rich for nothing, and there
was no way to package the CLI+TUI as a standalone binary without also dragging in
fastapi/uvicorn/python-jose. As distributed hosts (RM-08) and new model modalities (RM-09)
get added, this would only get worse.

**Done**: split `runtime/manager` into three separate `uv` workspace members, each with
its own `pyproject.toml` and version:
- `runtime/manager/core` → `prometheus-manager-core` — domain layer (config, registry,
  scanner, lifecycle, capacity, downloader, telemetry re-exports). Zero dependency on
  fastapi, click, or textual.
- `runtime/manager/api` → `prometheus-manager-api` — FastAPI app + routes + auth, plus a
  new thin `pmgr-api` CLI entrypoint (moved out of the old `pmgr serve` command). This is
  what `runtime/manager/api/Dockerfile` now builds — Textual/Rich never enter the image.
- `runtime/manager/tui` → `prometheus-manager-tui` — the Textual app/views/widgets plus
  the `pmgr` CLI (status/start/stop/pause/resume/restart/register/unregister/download/
  deregister/tui). No fastapi/uvicorn dependency at all — ready to be packaged as a
  standalone binary later without pulling in API-only deps.

All 142 pre-existing tests still pass, split 94/10/38 across core/api/tui. `.githooks/
pre-push` and `ci.yml` (which just runs the hook) now lint/format/type-check/test all
three independently.

Also paid down the ~86 pre-existing `mypy --strict` errors surfaced during RM-02 (mostly
missing annotations in the old `cli/main.py`, plus a handful in `config.py`/`downloader.py`/
`auth.py`/`routes.py`/every TUI view) — `mypy --strict` now passes clean on all three
packages, and the hook enforces it going forward.

Updated: `runtime/manager/AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` (repo layout diagrams +
test commands), `memory/wiki/deployment.md` and `memory/wiki/model-registry.md`
(`pmgr serve` → `pmgr-api`), `podman-compose.yml` / `podman-compose-ubuntu-dgx.yml`
(Dockerfile path), `scripts/install-rhel.sh` / `scripts/install-ubuntu-dgx.sh` /
`scripts/validate-ubuntu-dgx.sh` (`pmgr serve` → `pmgr-api`), and the
`scripts/tests/test_scripts_024.sh` assertions that checked the old command/path.

## RM-06 — Research the best inference-serving stack (item 7) — `done`

**Why**: `llama-server` is the only backend today. It may not be the best fit for every
hardware target (Apple Silicon vs NVIDIA DGX) or every future modality (RM-09).

**Done**: [memory/wiki/inference-engines.md](wiki/inference-engines.md) — full comparison
of llama.cpp, vLLM, MLX, and SGLang across Mac (M4 Max) / DGX Spark / generic Linux-NVIDIA,
covering throughput, quantization format support, modality coverage, and operational
complexity for a process-spawning manager. Bottom line: **mixed strategy, not a single
engine** — MLX on Mac, vLLM (or SGLang) on DGX Spark and generic Linux servers, llama.cpp
kept everywhere as the simple/single-user fallback. No engine covers every target modality
on every piece of hardware; the real design axis for RM-08/RM-09 is per-hardware backend
selection, not per-modality. The page also spells out concretely what this adds to the
manager's job — a second "heavy Python server" launch shape alongside the current
"spawn a binary" one, and new `registry.yaml` fields (`backend`, `quant_format`) — which
RM-08 and RM-09 should treat as their starting brief rather than re-deriving.

## RM-07 — Fine-grained per-model authorization scopes (item 2) — `done`

**Why**: today auth-service scopes are coarse (e.g. `inference:read`) — a client can call
any model the gateway exposes. Need per-model (and eventually per-modality: LLM/VLM/
multimodal) access control.

**Also found while scoping this**: `inference:read`/`inference:stream` were documented
scopes but were **never actually enforced** on `POST /v1/chat/completions` — any valid
JWT could already call any model. User chose (via AskUserQuestion) to fix this gap in the
same change, and to make the new per-model check **strict/deny-by-default** rather than
backward-compatible.

**Done**:
- `auth-service`: `model:<id>` scopes, additive to the fixed `VALID_SCOPES` enum —
  validated by pattern (`schemas.is_valid_scope`/`invalid_scopes`), not membership, since
  model ids are open-ended and live in the manager's registry, not auth-service. Wired
  into client registration/update (`admin.py`, `admin_ui.py` — a plain space-separated
  "Model access" text field, not a full redesign; RM-11 owns the real dashboard UI) and
  token issuance (`oauth2.py`). No DB migration needed — `allowed_scopes` was already a
  free-text space-separated column.
- `gateway`: `Claims.has_model_scope(model_id)`, enforced in `router.py`'s
  `chat_completions` handler — checked *after* the existing model-existence lookup (not
  before: `GET /v1/models` is already public/unauthenticated, so there's no secret to
  protect by hiding existence behind authorization, and doing it this way keeps
  unknown-model tests simple). Requires `inference:read`/`inference:stream` (now actually
  enforced) **and** `model:<id>` for the specific model requested.
- Confirmed the Web Chat UI (`ui/router.py`) is a separate proxy path that never calls
  `chat_completions` — unaffected by this change.

**⚠ Deployment/migration impact**: deny-by-default means **every client registered before
this shipped has zero model access** until an admin adds `model:<id>` scopes to it — see
[memory/wiki/auth-model.md](wiki/auth-model.md#per-model-scopes-rm-07) for the grant
command. Roll this out with that in mind; it will look like a total inference outage for
existing clients if deployed without a follow-up grant pass.

19 new tests (auth-service: scope validation, registration, token issuance; gateway:
`has_model_scope`, all-4 enforcement-order cases). All 84 auth-service + 119 gateway tests
pass (75/110 pre-existing — every existing gateway test token needed a `model:<id>` scope
added since the endpoint is now enforced). `mypy --strict` clean on both packages' `src/`.

## RM-08 — Distributed inference across multiple hosts (item 5) — `done`

**Why**: today the manager only starts/monitors `llama-server` processes on the local
host. You want to pool capacity across multiple machines (MacBook Pro M4 Max, NVIDIA DGX
Spark, etc.).

**Phase 1 done — multi-backend lifecycle (single host)**: before hosts can be distributed,
the manager needed to know how to launch more than one *kind* of server — this is the
"per-hardware backend selection" axis RM-06 called out as the harder, more foundational
question, and it turned out to be the more urgent gap. Implemented in `core`:
- `RegistryEntry.backend` (`llama_cpp`/`mlx`/`vllm`/`sglang`), with `path` validation
  relaxed for the three new backends (they commonly load a HF repo id directly, not a
  local `.gguf` file).
- `lifecycle.py`: one command-builder function per backend, dispatched on `entry.backend`.
  `llama_cpp` and `mlx` are verified against real binaries (`mlx_lm.server --help`, and a
  full live `register` → `start` → `status` → `stop` run against
  `mlx-community/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` on this Mac). `vllm`/`sglang` command construction
  follows their documented CLIs but is **not verified against real installs** — both need
  CUDA, unavailable in this dev environment. Validate on the DGX Spark/Linux target before
  relying on them.
- `scanner.py`: process recognition generalized to all four backends. Alias resolution now
  comes primarily from the PID file the manager already writes (`{pid_dir}/{model_id}.pid`)
  rather than backend-specific cmdline flags — necessary because `mlx_lm.server` has no
  `--alias`/`--served-model-name` equivalent at all.
- `config.py`: new `[backends.mlx/vllm/sglang]` sections for per-backend binary path and
  start timeout (vLLM/SGLang default to 300s vs. llama.cpp's 60s — heavier startup per
  RM-06's findings).
- `pmgr register --backend`, and a Backend column in the CLI tables, the Textual Registry
  view (table + detail panel), and the Instances view table.

**Phase 2 done — multi-host distribution via the gateway**: chosen architecture is "remote
manager + shared registry" — each host runs its own bare-metal `pmgr-api` (RM-05) with its
own `registry.yaml`; there is no new central orchestrator process. The gateway is the only
component aware of the whole fleet, and only as a *reader*:
- `gateway/config.py`: new `MANAGER_NODES` setting (`"name1=url1,name2=url2,..."`),
  resolved via `Settings.resolved_manager_nodes`. Takes priority over the existing
  single-node `MANAGER_URL`, which keeps working unchanged for existing deployments.
- `gateway/models/manager_sync.py`: `ManagerRegistrySync` now polls every configured
  node's `/v1/backends` concurrently (`asyncio.gather`) instead of a single manager. The
  SSRF-prevention host allowlist — previously a fixed loopback/container-alias list — is
  now dynamic: base hosts ∪ the hostname of every explicitly configured `MANAGER_NODES`
  entry, so remote routing is possible without opening the gateway up to arbitrary hosts.
  One node being unreachable only drops *that node's* models from the registry on the next
  poll (partial availability); a `model_id` collision across two nodes keeps the
  first-seen entry and logs a warning rather than silently overwriting.
- `gateway/models/registry.py`: `ModelEntry.node` field records which host serves a model
  (observability only, not used for routing).
- Each node's own `pmgr-api` must set `PMGR_PROXY_HOST` to its real reachable
  hostname/IP (not loopback) so its `/v1/backends` response reports a `backend_url` the
  gateway can actually route to. Full details and the operational setup: see
  `memory/wiki/model-registry.md` → "Distributed nodes (RM-08 phase 2)".

10 new tests (`gateway/tests/test_manager_sync.py`): node-config parsing (empty, single,
multi, priority-over-`MANAGER_URL`, malformed), dynamic allowlist computation, multi-node
merge, partial-availability on node failure, `model_id` collision handling, untrusted-host
rejection. 129/129 gateway tests pass; `ruff`/`mypy --strict` clean.

**What's not verified**: same caveat as phase 1's vLLM/SGLang — the config parsing and
sync logic are unit-tested against mocked HTTP responses, but the actual cross-machine
`PMGR_PROXY_HOST` rewrite was not exercised against two real separate hosts (no second
machine available in this dev environment). Validate on the real fleet (Mac + DGX Spark,
etc.) before relying on it in production.

## RM-09 — Multi-modal model support (item 6) — `done` (VLM + embeddings)

**Why**: today the platform only serves text LLMs. You want VLM, multimodal, audio,
image-generation, video-generation, and embedding models.

**Scope decision**: the original ask covers four distinct API surfaces (VLM, audio,
image/video-gen, embeddings) — too much for one lightweight branch. Scoped down to VLM +
embeddings (user-selected): both reuse the existing chat/proxy infrastructure instead of
needing a new pipeline shape, and cover the most immediately useful cases (RAG via
embeddings, image understanding via VLM). Audio and image/video generation are separate,
larger follow-up items — see "What's not covered" below.

**Manager (`core`)**:
- `RegistryEntry.modality` (`text`/`vision`/`embedding`, default `text`) and
  `RegistryEntry.mmproj_path` (vision projector file). `pmgr register --modality
  --mmproj-path`.
- `lifecycle.py`: `_build_llama_cpp_cmd` adds `--embedding` for `modality: embedding` and
  `--mmproj <mmproj_path>` for `modality: vision` — both real llama-server flags. Only
  `llama_cpp` dispatches on modality today; `mlx`/`vllm`/`sglang` accept the field but
  don't act on it yet (documented gap, same shape as phase 1's unverified vLLM/SGLang).
- TUI: Modality column in `pmgr list`/registry view + detail panel.

**Gateway**:
- `ChatMessage.content` now accepts either a plain string or an OpenAI-shaped content-part
  array (`text` / `image_url`). `image_url.url` must be a `data:` URI — remote http(s)
  URLs are rejected to prevent the backend from being used as an SSRF proxy.
- `/v1/chat/completions` returns `400 modality-mismatch` if a request has an `image_url`
  part but the target model's `modality != "vision"`.
- New `POST /v1/embeddings` (OpenAI-shaped `{model, input}`) — same auth chain as chat
  completions (`inference:read` + per-model `model:<id>` grant, RM-07), `400
  modality-mismatch` if the model isn't `modality: embedding`.
- `ModelEntry.modality` threaded through the static registry loader, `ManagerRegistrySync`,
  and exposed on `GET /v1/models` / `GET /v1/backends`.

**What's verified**: both llama_cpp flags were checked against a real llama-server build on
this Mac — `--embedding` launched `second-state/All-MiniLM-L6-v2-Embedding-GGUF` and served
a real `/v1/embeddings` response; `--mmproj` launched `ggml-org/SmolVLM-256M-Instruct-GGUF`
and correctly answered a real image content-part chat request (both via direct curl against
the manager-launched command, not through the full gateway auth stack — that stack is
already covered by existing JWT/scope tests). 22 new tests (10 manager-core, 13 gateway
minus 1 that's schema-only) — full details in `memory/wiki/model-registry.md` "Modalities
(RM-09)".

**What's not covered** (follow-up items, not RM-09): audio (whisper.cpp), image/video
generation (diffusers/ComfyUI), and modality-specific dispatch for `mlx`/`vllm`/`sglang`
(e.g. `mlx-vlm`/`mlx-whisper`).

## RM-10 — Gateway admin dashboard (item 3)

**Why**: no visual way today to see running instances, downloaded models, or manage
inference lifecycle — only `pmgr` TUI (bare-metal) and raw API calls.

**Scope**: a web dashboard in the gateway (or a new UI module) showing live instances,
downloaded models, and start/stop/restart controls — consuming the manager REST API
cleaned up in RM-05.

## RM-11 — Auth module dashboard redesign (item 1)

**Why**: current auth UI needs an enterprise-grade redesign.

**Scope**: redesign the existing auth-service web UI. Do this together with or right after
RM-07 so the new UI is built once against the final (fine-grained) permission model instead
of being redone.

## RM-12 — E2E LLM tracing with Langfuse (item 8)

**Why**: current observability (Loki/Tempo/Grafana + OTel, specs 018/020/021/022) is
generic request tracing, not LLM-specific (prompts, completions, token usage, evals).

**Scope**: integrate Langfuse (self-hosted, matches the "open" requirement) alongside the
existing telemetry package — fine-grained end-to-end trace of prompt → model → completion,
without duplicating what Tempo already captures at the HTTP layer.
